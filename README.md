# Bluetooth Remote Control
This project enables control of Home Assistant entities using an ESP32 device equipped with physical buttons and connected to a mobile phone via Bluetooth. A dedicated Android application receives commands from the ESP32 over Bluetooth and forwards them to the Home Assistant instance over the internet. 
The system is specifically designed to open the garage door from within a car.
